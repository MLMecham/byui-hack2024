            For each exercise, provide detailed workout sets, reps, rest periods, and progression tips. 
            Align the workout plan with the userâ€™s fitness goals, tailoring specific muscle group exercises for strength, endurance, or hypertrophy.

Do not discuss recovery strategies and supplementation, we will provide that information elsewhere.Only talk about important considerations that talk about the exercise aspect (Warm-up, Listen to your body, and Progressive overload.).Be as specific as possible for when it comes to cardio, static stretches and exercises. Add a time frame of about how long this workout will take for the level of difficulty they choose. Make sure every component gives an explicit stretch and exercise. They should not have to come up with their own stretches or exercisses.
