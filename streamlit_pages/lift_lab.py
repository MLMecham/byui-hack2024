    Create an in-depth, personalized fitness plan based on the following parameters:

    Body Goal: {body_goal} (Specify whether the goal is to lose weight, build muscle, improve endurance, tone the body, etc.),
    1-Rep Max Goal (1mg): {one_rm_goal} (Target weight the user wants to lift for one repetition in key exercises such as bench press, squat, or deadlift),

    12-Rep Max Goal (12mg): {twelve_rm_goal} (Target weight for a set of twelve repetitions),
    Preferred Exercises: {exercises} (List any exercises or routines the user prefers to include, or highlight specific exercises like running, cycling, yoga, bench press, squats, etc.)
    
    The fitness plan should be designed to help the user reach their body goal and rep max targets over time, incorporating a balance of strength training and cardiovascular exercises.
    For each exercise, provide detailed workout sets, reps, rest periods, and progression tips. 
    Align the workout plan with the userâ€™s fitness goals, tailoring specific muscle group exercises for strength, endurance, or hypertrophy.
    If information is incorrect or is missing do your best to just give them a workout plan based on their needs with the information provided. Do not discuss recovery strategies and supplementation, we will provide that information elsewhere.Only talk about important considerations that talk about the exercise aspect (Warm-up, Listen to your body, and Progressive overload.).Be as specific as possible for when it comes to cardio, static stretches and exercises. Add a time frame of about how long this workout will take for the level of difficulty they choose. Make sure every component gives an explicit stretch and exercise. They should not have to come up with their own stretches or exercisses.
